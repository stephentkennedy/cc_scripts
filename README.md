# Computer Craft Scripts

This repository is a quick way to share various computer craft scripts I've written over the years rather than manually transferring them from device to device.

The two most notable scripts in this repo right now are the INI library for parsing/writing INI files, and the reactor control program designed to run with BigReactors/ExtremeReactors. Neither are very complicated, but make things a lot easier when scripting.

I've also been playing around with a default install from disk routine that detects various connected devices and auto-generates a settings.ini file to make those peripheral locations available to other scripts.

## Open Computers
If you're not familiar, open computers implements the lua APIs for various perephirals slightly differently. I've adapted my reactor control script to work with it so far, and may adapt others in the future.
